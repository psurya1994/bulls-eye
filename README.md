# Bulls Eye: A Portable Corneal Topograpy Device

This is the algorithm for the Srujana Innovation Center project, Bulls Eye expected to be a low-cost hand held corneal topography device.

The code here needs the following functions from MATLAB file exchange to be imported. 
- Adaptive Threshold by Guanglei Xiong ([link](http://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8647-local-adaptive-thresholding))
- Surf from Scatter by ([link](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5105-making-surface-plots-from-scatter-data))

Run the function be_main.m to see the results.
